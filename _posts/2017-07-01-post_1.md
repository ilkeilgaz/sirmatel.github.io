In this post we will examine how to build a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) with guaranteed stability using MATLAB. The stability property is obtained by construction using the quasi-infinite horizon (QIH) method proposed in Chen & Allgöwer (1998)[^Chen1998].

In the QIH-NMPC method the finite horizon constrained optimal control problem is formulated as

$$\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} & \quad \int_{0}^{T}{\left\Vert x(t)\right\Vert^2_Q + \left\Vert u(t)\right\Vert^2_R} ~dt + \left\Vert x(T)\right\Vert^2_P  \\
\text{subject to} & \quad x(0) = x_0 \\
& \quad x(T) \in \Omega \\
& \quad \text{for } t \in [0,T]: \\
& \qquad \dot{x}(t) = f(x(t),u(t)) \\
& \qquad x(t) \in \mathcal{X} \\
& \qquad u(t) \in \mathcal{U},
\end{align*}$$

where $x(t) \in \mathcal{R}^n$ is the state, $u(t) \in \mathcal{R}^m$ is the control input, $f(\cdot)$ is the dynamics, $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are the sets expressing state and control input constraints, respectively, $x_0$ is the measurement, $T$ is the prediction horizon, $Q \in \mathcal{R}^{n \times n}$, $R \in \mathcal{R}^{m \times m}$, and $P \in \mathcal{R}^{n \times n}$ are matrices specifying the weights on the state, control input, and the terminal state, respectively, whereas $\Omega$ is the terminal region.

The QIH-NMPC method ensures stability via obtaining the terminal cost (specified by $P$) and the terminal state constraint (specified by $\Omega$) such that
