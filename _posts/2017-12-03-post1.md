In this post we will study how to implement a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme with MATLAB and CasADi. We will use the nonlinear system from Chen and Allgöwer (1998)[^Chen1998] as example, which has the following dynamics:

$$\begin{align*}
\dot{x}_1(t) & = x_2(t) + u(t) \left( \mu + (1 - \mu)x_1(t) \right) \\
\dot{x}_2(t) & = x_1(t) + u(t) \left( \mu - 4(1 - \mu)x_2(t) \right).
\end{align*}$$

NMPC involves finite horizon constrained nonlinear optimal control problems in the following form

$$\begin{align*}
\text{minimize} & \quad \int_{0}^{T}{\left\Vert x(t)\right\Vert^2_Q + \left\Vert u(t)\right\Vert^2_R} ~dt  \\
\text{subject to} & \quad x(0) = x_0 \\
& \quad \text{for } t \in [0,T]: \\
& \qquad \dot{x}(t) = f(x(t),u(t)) \\
& \qquad x(t) \in \mathcal{X} \\
& \qquad u(t) \in \mathcal{U},
\end{align*}$$

where $x(t) \in \mathcal{R}^n$ is the state, $u(t) \in \mathcal{R}^m$ is the control input, the function $f(\cdot)$ represents the dynamics, $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are the sets expressing state and control input constraints, respectively, $x_0$ is the measurement, $T$ is the prediction horizon, whereas $Q \in \mathcal{R}^{n \times n}$ and $R \in \mathcal{R}^{m \times m}$ are matrices specifying the weights on the state and control input, respectively.

The QIH-NMPC method ensures stability via obtaining the terminal cost (specified by $P$) and the terminal region (specified by $P$ and $\alpha$) with specific features: The terminal region specifies an invariant set of the nonlinear system under a local linear controller, whereas the terminal cost represents an upper bound on the infinite horizon cost starting from the terminal state inside $\Omega$ under said linear controller. 

As application example, consider the following two-dimensional nonlinear system from Chen and Allgöwer (1998)[^Chen1998]

$$\begin{align*}
\dot{x}_1(t) & = x_2(t) + u(t) \left( \mu + (1 - \mu)x_1(t) \right) \\
\dot{x}_2(t) & = x_1(t) + u(t) \left( \mu - 4(1 - \mu)x_2(t) \right),
\end{align*}$$

with $\mu = 0.5$. The control input constraint set is

$$\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{U} = \{ u \in \mathcal{R}^1 ~:~ -2 \leq u \leq -2 \},
\end{equation*}$$

whereas the weighting matrices are chosen as
