Isik Ilber Sirmatel received the B.Sc. degrees in mechanical and control engineering from the Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, and the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Urban Transport Systems Laboratory, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. His research interests include automatic control, optimization, and model predictive control, with applications to control of transportation systems.

## Current work:

- Economic model predictive control of large-scale urban networks via perimeter control and route guidance
- Mixed logical dynamical modeling and hybrid model predictive control of bus transport systems
- Nonlinear model predictive control of highway traffic via variable speed limits
- Nonlinear moving horizon estimation for large-scale urban networks
