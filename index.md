Işık İlber Sırmatel received the B.Sc. degrees in mechanical and control engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Turkey, and the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), Switzerland, in 2010, 2012, and 2014, respectively. He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the Urban Transport Systems Laboratory (LUTS), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPF Lausanne), Switzerland. His research interests include automatic control, optimization, and model predictive control, with applications to control of transportation systems.

## Current work:

- Economic model predictive control of large-scale urban networks via perimeter control and route guidance
- Mixed logical dynamical modeling and hybrid model predictive control of bus transport systems
- Nonlinear model predictive control of highway traffic via variable speed limits
- Nonlinear moving horizon estimation for large-scale urban networks
